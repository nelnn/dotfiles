# Dotfiles
My operating system is OS X. To use my configuration, first run
```bash
source brew.sh
```
This installs [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and the relevent packages for neovim. Some casks and pacakges are 
not required.


Next, create all the symlinks in the `~/.config/` directory by running
```bash
source config.sh
```
You should be all good to go.
